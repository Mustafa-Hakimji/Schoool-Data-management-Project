# Schoool-Data-management-Project
I am working on a project to manage teh data of all students who are registered with the schol and through which we can able to get and post student data from any where in school. 

1. Please clone my repository by running the command "git clone {link}".
2. Open your source code editor and go the folder where you had clone the project.
3. Opne you terminal and run ~~~command ~~~npm install or npm i~~~.
4. After installation is complete please run command nodemon app.js to run the project (node).
5. For testing the API you can use "POST MAN".


Thats all for now....
Thanks & Regards
